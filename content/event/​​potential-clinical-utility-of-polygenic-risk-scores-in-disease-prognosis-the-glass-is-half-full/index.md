title: ​​Potential clinical utility of polygenic risk scores in disease
  prognosis. The glass is half full.
abstract: Most research on polygenic risk scores (PRSs) focuses on incidence of
  diseases, not their prognosis. In the clinic, prediction of disease outcomes
  happens however more frequently in at-risk than in healthy individuals. Here,
  we explore the utility of polygenic risk scores (PRSs) for disease prognosis
  using electronic health records of 392,649 Finns.
