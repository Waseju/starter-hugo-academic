title: ​​Potential clinical utility of polygenic risk scores in disease
  prognosis. The glass is half full.
abstract: >
  Most research on polygenic risk scores (PRSs) focuses on incidence of
  diseases, not their prognosis. In the clinic, prediction of disease outcomes
  happens however more frequently in at-risk than in healthy individuals. Here,
  we explore the utility of polygenic risk scores (PRSs) for disease prognosis
  using electronic health records of 392,649 Finns. First, we investigate
  clinical settings where a patient presents with an unspecified symptom that
  may be a sign of a more severe disease. For example, we explore the clinical
  case of an unspecified first seizure at risk to develop epilepsy and unclear
  stomach complaints (irritable bowel syndrome, IBS) at risk to develop an
  autoimmune inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In 7,770 individuals with IBS, we
  found that individuals with the top 5% of IBD-PRS showed an increased relative
  risk (HR 2.3, 95% CI 1.57-3.40, p=2.19*10-5) of developing IBD after 10 years
  compared to individuals with lower IBD-PRS with a larger effect in young
  adults (age < 40). Furthermore, we show that the cumulative lifetime incidence
  of IBD reaches ca 22% in individuals with the top 5% of IBD-PRS and a previous
  IBS diagnosis, while individuals without a previous IBS diagnosis remain at a
  lower risk (ca 10%). By an increase in absolute risk after a first milder or
  unspecific event we thus highlight ways to potentially improve the clinical
  utility of disease incidence PRS in stratifying risk of severe disease.
  Additionally, we explored the potential of PRSs of disease incidence to
  predict prognosis such as disease severity. In the example of IBD, we used
  IBD-related surgery as a proxy for disease severity. Here the top 5% of
  IBD-PRS show an increased risk of undergoing total colectomy compared to the
  rest of the cohort (HR 1.52, 95% CI 1.15-2.02, p=3.78*10-3), indicating
  similarities in the genetic architecture for incidence and progression of IBD.
  We investigate the predictive value of incidence PRSs on disease prognosis in
  multiple other diseases such as atrial fibrillation, epilepsy and prostate
  cancer. We find a substantial correlation between genetic factors influencing
  disease incidence and disease severity for some but not all diseases and in
  some cases attenuation of PRS effects due to selection bias. Analyses are
  replicated in a biobank network (n=1.2 Million). We thus present potential
  applications of PRSs for predicting factors of disease prognosis.
